    Based on the source code, write/rewrite tests to cover the source code.

    Repository: type-fest

    Source File Path: source/async-return-type.d.ts

    Test File Path: test-d/async-return-type.ts

    Project Programming Language: typescript

    Testing Framework: tsd

    ### Source File Content

    ### Source File Content:

    type AsyncFunction = (...arguments_: any[]) => PromiseLike<unknown>;


    /**

    Unwrap the return type of a function that returns a `Promise`.


    There has been [discussion](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/35998)
    about implementing this type in TypeScript.


    @example

    ```ts

    import type {AsyncReturnType} from ''type-fest'';

    import {asyncFunction} from ''api'';


    // This type resolves to the unwrapped return type of `asyncFunction`.

    type Value = AsyncReturnType<typeof asyncFunction>;


    async function doSomething(value: Value) {}


    asyncFunction().then(value => doSomething(value));

    ```


    @category Async

    */

    export type AsyncReturnType<Target extends AsyncFunction> = Awaited<ReturnType<Target>>;
